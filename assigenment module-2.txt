1. What is Exploratory Testing?

Exploratory Testing is an informal testing approach where testers explore the application
 without predefined test cases, learning the system and designing tests simultaneously.


2. What is a Traceability Matrix?

A Traceability Matrix (RTM) maps requirements to test cases to ensure 
all requirements are covered and validated during testing.



3. What is Boundary Value Testing?

Boundary Value Testing checks the behavior of software at boundary
 conditions (minimum, maximum, just inside/outside limits).



4. What is Equivalence Partitioning Testing?

Equivalence Partitioning divides input data into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases are derived,
 reducing total test cases while maintaining coverage.



5. What is Integration Testing?

Integration Testing verifies the interfaces and interaction
 between integrated components or modules.



6. What Determines the Level of Risk?

Risk level is determined by impact (severity of failure)
 and likelihood (probability of occurrence).



7. What is Alpha Testing?

Alpha Testing is conducted by internal teams (developers/testers)
 before releasing the product to external users.



8. What is Beta Testing?

Beta Testing is done by real users in a real environment
 before final release to gather feedback.



9. What is Component Testing?

Component (Unit) Testing verifies the functionality 
of individual modules or components in isolation.



10. What is Functional System Testing?

It checks the complete system’s functionality as per requirements,
 ensuring end-to-end behavior works correctly.



11. What is Non-Functional Testing?

It tests non-functional aspects like performance,
 security, usability, reliability, and scalability.




13. What is Adhoc Testing?

Adhoc Testing is informal and unstructured testing without planning or documentation,
 relying on tester intuition.



14. What is Load Testing?

Load Testing checks system performance
 under expected user loads.



15. What is Stress Testing?

Stress Testing evaluates system behavior under 
extreme or beyond-limit conditions.



16. What is White Box Testing? List its types.

White Box Testing involves testing internal logic or code structure.
Types: Statement coverage and Branch coverage.



17. What is Black Box Testing? What are its techniques?

Black Box Testing focuses on functionality without looking into code.
Techniques:
 Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing,
 State Transition, and Use Case Testing.



18. Mention Categories of Defects.

Functional Defects

Performance Defects

Usability Defects

Compatibility Defects

Security Defects



19. What is Big Bang Testing?

Big Bang Testing integrates all components at once and tests
 the entire system — usually used for small projects.



20. What is the Purpose of Exit Criteria?

Exit criteria define the conditions under which testing can be
 stopped (e.g., all critical bugs fixed, 95% test coverage).




22. What are 7 Key Principles of Testing?

Testing shows the presence of defects.

Exhaustive testing is impossible.

Early testing saves time and cost.

Defects cluster together.

Pesticide paradox (tests need updating).

Testing depends on context.

Absence-of-errors fallacy.




24. Difference Between Smoke and Sanity Testing

Smoke Testing: Basic build verification test after a new build.

Sanity Testing: Checks new functionality after minor fixes/updates.



25. Difference Between Verification and Validation

Verification: Ensures product is built correctly (process check).

Validation: Ensures the right product is built (requirement check).



26. Types of Performance Testing

Load Testing

Stress Testing

Spike Testing

Endurance (Soak) Testing

Volume Testing

Scalability Testing



27. What is Error, Defect, Bug, and Failure?

Error: Mistake by developer in code or logic.

Defect/Bug: Error found during testing.

Failure: When system doesn’t perform expected functionality in production.
