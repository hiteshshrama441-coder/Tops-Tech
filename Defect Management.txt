1. What is the Bug Life Cycle?

The Bug Life Cycle (or Defect Life Cycle) is the process a defect goes through from the moment it is found until it is closed.
It defines the states a bug moves through and how teams handle it.


Typical Bug Life Cycle Stages

.New – Tester reports the bug for the first time.

.Assigned – Lead/manager assigns it to a developer.

.Open – Developer starts analyzing and working on the bug.

.Fixed – Developer applies a fix.

.Retest – Tester verifies if the fix works.

.Verified – Tester confirms the bug is gone.

.Closed – Bug is successfully fixed and closed.


Other Possible States

.Rejected – Bug is invalid.

.Deferred – Bug fix is postponed.

.Duplicate – Bug already exists.

.Not a Bug – Expected behavior.






2. Difference between Functional Testing and Non-Functional Testing

| Functional Testing                                                Non-Functional Testing                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Checks **what the system does** (features/behaviors).      | Checks **how the system performs** (quality attributes).                |
| Validates requirements like input, output, business logic. | Validates performance, usability, security, reliability, etc.           |
| Example: login, search, payment, form submission.          | Example: load testing, stress testing, security testing, UI/UX testing. |
| Based on **user/business requirements**.                   | Based on **quality attributes** and performance criteria.               |
| Done by **testers**.                                       | Done by **testers + specialized teams** (performance/security).         |






1. Difference between Test Scenarios, Test Cases, and Test Scripts
Test Scenario

.A high-level description of what to test.

.It represents end-to-end functionality.

Example: Verify user can log in successfully.

Test Case

.A detailed document explaining how to test a scenario.

.Includes steps, inputs, expected results.

Example: Steps to enter username/password and check login result.

Test Script

.A set of instructions written in a scripting/programming language for automation.

.Used in tools like Selenium, Cypress, etc.






 2. What is a Test Plan? What information should it cover?

A Test Plan is a formal document describing:

.What to test

.How to test

.When to test

.Who will test

It is a roadmap for testing activities.

Contents of a Test Plan

.Test objectives

.Scope of testing (In-scope / Out-of-scope)

.Test strategy (types of testing to be performed)

.Test environment details

.Test deliverables

.Resources & responsibilities

.Schedule & timelines

.Entry and exit criteria

.Tools to be used

.Risk and mitigation plans




3. What is Priority?

.Priority defines how urgently a bug must be fixed.

.Set by: Project Manager / Product Owner.

.Focus: Business impact and deadlines.




4. What is Severity?

.Severity defines how serious the bug is from a technical perspective.

.Set by: Tester/QA.

.Focus: Impact on functionality.





5. Bug Categories

.Common bug categories include:

.Functional bugs

.Performance bugs

.Security bugs

.UI/UX bugs

.Compatibility bugs

.Logical / calculation bugs

.Integration bugs

.Usability bugs

.Documentation bugs





6. Advantages of Bugzilla

Bugzilla is an open-source bug-tracking tool.
Advantages:

.Free and open source

.Easy to track and manage defects

.Customizable workflows

.Email notifications for updates

.Supports advanced search & reporting

.Role-based access control

.Integration with version control systems

.Supports attachment of screenshots/logs





7. Difference between Priority and Severity

|     Severity                        |      Priority                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Indicates **impact of the defect**. | Indicates **urgency to fix**.                                      |
| Set by **QA/Testers**.              | Set by **Managers/Product Owners**.                                |
| Technical perspective.              | Business perspective.                                              |
| Example: App crash = High severity. | Example: Crash during a rare scenario might be low priority today. |
